    Bike sharing demand aims to forecast the use of the bikeshare system throughout the city. This is an automated system of renting bicycles. The process of obtaining membership, rental and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations through out a city. The target of this project is to predict the total count of bikes rented each hour covered by test set using only information available prior to the rental period.
